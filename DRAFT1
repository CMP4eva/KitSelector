## sunny weather kit
awk = ['sunglasses', 'hat', 'hiking boots']

##hot weather kit = hwk
hwk = ['threeqtr hikers', 'rash guard', 'hiking boots']

##dodgy weather kit
dwk = ['full length hikers', 'rash guard', 'spray top', 'neoprene socks', 'hiking boots']

##cold weather kit
cwk = ['drysuit', 'baselayers', 'wool knee socks' ]

##So this is where you defined the loop and I definitely wouldn’t have gotten here on my own but I think I can make it work in a6. I guess we’ll see. 

a = 'y'


#dsw = allconditions + hwk + dwk + cwk
print ('Welcome to the Sailing Kit program; we will help you identify the right kit to keep you safe, warm and competitive on the water!')

x = str(input ('What is your name?:'))

print ('Hello,', (x),'!!! Let\'s get you suited up to have a great day on the water!')

while a == 'y' or a == 'Y':
    start = int(input('What is the temperature (in F?): '))
    if start<75:
        print (start, '!!!')
        print(' You need to wear clothes for cold weather!:', awk + cwk)

    if start==75:
        print(start,'!!! This is the midAtlantic! Wear clothes for unreliable weather!: ', awk + dwk)

    else:
        print (start,'!!! Wear clothes for hot weather!:', awk + hwk)

##and this is where you recycle or closed the loop.  If a == anything not “y” then it will close the loop and pop the user out of the program. 

    a = input('Has the weather already changed again? Y/N: ')

print ('That\'ll change! but until then have fun and sail fast!')
